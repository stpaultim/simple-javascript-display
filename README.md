A Simple Javascript Display

This was created for a friend of mine for a pretty simple use case. 
She wanted to display a basic HTML page with a flexible number of products. 
Each product will have a small image with a link to open a modal window 
with a larger version of the image. 

A few notes about the requirements:

* The page is not responsive or mobile friendly. 
* We did not worry about old browsers
* This page is Javascript dependent

To use this page, just edit the "product-list.js" file, with the information about each 
product. The markup for display.html page is generated by display.js
